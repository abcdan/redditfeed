# redditfeed
A Reddit feed for those who want to comment on the latest posts on Reddit.
For now I have the project running on Glitch but I'm planning on moving it to Heroku (since there is no 4k request/hour limit). Check it out over [here](https://redditfeed.glitch.me/)

# Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Make a rename the `config.env` to `.env` and fill in the details (make the app on Reddit on [this](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) page. Check the next part of the README to see how to do it if you don't understand).
4. `node app.js` to run the script
5. Go to your browser on port 80 (or your process.env.PORT)
6. Enjoy!

# To make the Application on reddit
1. Go to [this](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) page
2. Click the "are you a developer?"
3. Fill in the stuff, be sure to make it use "script"
